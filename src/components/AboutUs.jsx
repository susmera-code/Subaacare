        <p>
          At <strong>Subaa Care</strong>, our mission is simple yet deeply personal —
          to bring trusted, verified, and compassionate healthcare professionals to
          the comfort of your home.
        </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Our Founder’s Journey</h5>
        <p>
          Subaa Care was founded by an IT professional with over 20 years of experience,
          specializing in managing large-scale IT services across multinational
          companies and reputed hospitals in India and abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, this journey provided deep exposure to process excellence,
          service reliability, data security, and people management — all critical
          elements in delivering dependable healthcare services.
        </p>
        <p>
          While technology has been the professional foundation, care has always been
          the purpose.
        </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Why Subaa Care Was Born</h5>

        <h6 className="fw-semibold mt-3">A Personal Turning Point</h6>
        <p>
          When the founder’s father suffered a stroke, he lost his ability to speak and
          experienced paralysis on the right side of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support his recovery, the family transformed a one-bedroom home into a
          fully assisted care space, equipped with medical beds, mobility aids,
          physiotherapy support, and continuous nursing care.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience revealed first-hand the emotional, physical, and logistical
          challenges families face when arranging quality home healthcare.
        </p>

        <h6 className="fw-semibold mt-3">A Gap That Needed Attention</h6>
        <p>During this journey, it became evident that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Home healthcare services largely operate in an unorganized and referral-based ecosystem
          </li>
          <li>
            Families struggle with trust, quality assurance, and professional accountability
          </li>
          <li>
            Verifying credentials, experience, and background of caregivers is often difficult
          </li>
          <li>
            There is limited transparency in pricing, service standards, and escalation mechanisms
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This realization inspired the creation of <strong>Subaa Care</strong> — to organize,
          standardize, and elevate home healthcare services using technology, process
          discipline, and compassion.
        </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">What Makes Subaa Care Different</h5>
